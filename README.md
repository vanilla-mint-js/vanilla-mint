# VanillaMints

## Why?

### Because I don't want:

    1. A devtime compiler (other than TypeScript processors) (Svelte)
    1. A runtime (other than JavaScript) (Angular/React)
    1. A virtual DOM (React)
    1. A massive framework (Angular)
    1. Technological lock-in (All frameworks/libraries basically limit code portability)
    1. Change-detection cycles and batching (Angular)
    1. Obfuscation due to excessive abstraction (Angular)
    1. An ever-changing framework/library API (React)

### And because I do want:

    1. Basic ability to customize the web
    1. True reactivity (via Observables)
    1. Ability to author most of my components in one agnostic technology instead of re-implementing the same thing every time I have to work on a different framework
    1. Portability to run my components inside another framework or in a simple HTML file w/ a script block or import
    1. Fast builds and small bundles (using Vite)

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
